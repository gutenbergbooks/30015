<h2><i>By<br />

<div class="bk3"><p><big><b>Early morning deliveries were part of
the Honeychile Bakery Service. But on this
particular morning the service was reversed!</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> 2:34 a.m., Patrolman Louis
Whedbee left the Zip Cab
station. With arch supports
squeaking and night stick swinging,
Whedbee walked east to the call
box at the corner of Sullivan and
Cherokee. The traffic signal suspended
above the intersection
blinked a cautionary amber. Not
a car moved on the silent streets.</p>

<p>Whedbee reached for the box.
Then he swore softly and stepped
off the curb. "Pardon me," he said,
for he believed that a policeman
should be courteous at all times,
even when arresting a school zone
speedster. This, however, was not
a speedster. It seemed to be a
huge man standing on top of a
truck and cutting down the stop
light. "What's going on here?"
Whedbee asked.</p>

<p>HONEYCHILE BAKERY was
advertised on the side of the truck.
Instinctively, Whedbee jammed his
whistle in his mouth when he
realized that the man on the truck
wore something like a suit of long
underwear made of improbable
black fur sprinkled with tiny red
spots.</p>

<p>"What are you doing to the stop
light?" Whedbee demanded.</p>

<p>The amber light quit blinking
without the expected electrical display.
Sinuous as beheaded snakes,
the wires and cables supporting the
traffic signal fell into the street.
The unusual man pocketed his
cutting tool&mdash;a long thin tube&mdash;and
lowered the stop light to the
truck. He looked at Whedbee.
The corner street lamp reacted
upon his eyes like a flashlight
thrown on a tomcat in an alley.
The eyes gleamed green.</p>

<p>Whedbee's whistle arced to the
end of the chain and clanked
against his metal buttons. A block
away on Center Street, a heavy
truck roared through the business
section. The bell of a switch engine
tolled near the freight depot,
and a small dog barked suddenly
at the obscured sky.</p>

<p>"I am promoting you to captain.
You will replace Hanks, whom I
am demoting," the figure on the
truck announced.</p>

<p>"Chief Grindstaff?" Whedbee
wondered.</p>

<p>The chief of police glared down
at the patrolman. He hooked a
bright metal globe to the stop
light, lifted it in one hand, and
jumped, landing lightly on the
pavement. "Put this in the mobile
unit," he said. "The truck, I
evil."</p>

<p>"Huh? Sure, chief," Whedbee
said. He tucked his night stick
under his arm and prepared to accept
a heavy load. Tensed muscles
almost felled him when the
signal proved to weigh not more
than one pound.</p>

<p>Chief Grindstaff opened the
doors in the rear of the truck, releasing
a faint odor of stale bread.
The truck was empty. Whedbee
deposited the almost weightless
burden. The chief looked him in
the eye. "I am promoting you to
captain," he repeated. "You will
replace Hanks, whom I am demoting."</p>

<p>"Thanks, chief!" Whedbee exalted.
"You know Hanks didn't
treat me fair that time I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about that,"
the chief interposed. "Go bring
the postage box and place it in
the truck."</p>

<p>"The which? Oh, you mean
the mailbox!" Whedbee walked
across the street to the
square green box with the rounded
metal top. Another of the globes
had been attached to the mailbox,
and the legs had been burned loose
from the concrete sidewalk. Confidently,
Whedbee lifted the light
object, carried it to the truck, and
deposited it inside.</p>

<p>"Bleachers there," said Chief
Grindstaff.</p>

<p>"What you say, chief?"</p>

<p>"Stands there. No, stand there."</p>

<p>Patrolman Whedbee stood by
the back of the truck. Chief
Grindstaff placed a device like
an atomizer under Whedbee's nose
and released the spray.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Miss</span> Betsy Tapp awoke after
not more than one hour of
fitful sleep. The door to the garage
apartment shook under the
tattoo of a heavy fist. Miss Tapp's
heart thudded somewhere inside her
thirty-eight-inch bosom. She lay
rigid in darkness penetrated only
by the glimmer of a distant street
light.</p>

<p>The knocking ceased. Boards
creaked on the platform outside
the door. A face appeared at the
window, a face in complete shadow
except for two eyes that glowed
with greenish light.</p>

<p>Miss Tapp, unaware of the disarray
of her nightgown, sat upright.
The alarm clock on the
floor by the bed clacked in the
stillness. The tap in the kitchen
cubicle dripped. Timbers, contracting
in the cool of early morning,
popped faintly.</p>

<p>"I need to marry you," the face
said. "I was wrong tonight. Forgive
me."</p>

<p>"Fred?" Miss Tapp gasped in
sudden joy.</p>

<p>"Open the portal," Fred said.</p>

<p>Wrenching metal curlers from
her permanently waved hair, Miss
Tapp bounded to the door. She released
the catch and threw herself
at the figure on the landing.
Fred purred, "I want to marry you.
I was wrong tonight. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Fred," Miss Tapp sighed.
"I knew you'd come back! You
just had too much to drink! I
forgive you, Fred! We'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Bring your rayon crepe
with tall tucking."</p>

<p>"What, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Bring your garb, your clothing.
Hurry."</p>

<p>Miss Tapp skillfully fought a
blush. "Oh, Fred! I'm sorry.
I'll be dressed in a minute!"</p>

<p>Fred slowly stated, "I want to
marry you. I was wrong tonight.
Forgive me." He walked into the
apartment and rapidly gathered
and rolled together the dress and
undergarments scattered on and
about the chair. He stuffed the
spike-heeled shoes into pockets
of his black fur suit and lifted
Miss Tapp in his arms.</p>

<p>"We're eloping!" Miss Tapp
sighed as Fred carried her down
the outside stairs. A <i>Honeychile
Bakery</i> truck, with rear doors open,
waited in the driveway. Fred
tossed the roll of clothing and the
slippers into the truck, and swiftly
sprayed Miss Tapp.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">An</span> unearthly glow permeated
the bedroom and cast the
black shadows of heavy furniture
against the faded papered walls.
Within the glow, two dots of green
flickered. The Reverend Enos
Shackelford dropped on creaking
knees and bowed his grizzled head.</p>

<p>A voice said, "Well done, good
and faithful servant. Arise and
follow me."</p>

<p>"Lord," said Reverend Shackelford,
"I have served thee faithfully
all the days of my life. Remember
me when thou comest into thy
kingdom. Remember also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well done, good and
faithful servant. Arise and follow
me."</p>

<p>Shackelford stood on tottering
old legs. His nightshirt hung below
his knees. Horrified shock
blanched his lined face. "Blasphemer!"
he cried. "False prophet!
Get thee behind me, Satan!"</p>

<p>The glow danced and faded. A
towering black shape pointed a
bent rod. The rod hissed. The
Reverend Shackelford staggered
against a small table, dragging it
with him to the floor. He lay still
with one gnarled old hand on a
large golden-edged book that had
fallen from the table.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You're</span> fired," the man in
the dream said over and
over.</p>

<p>Calvin C. Kear rolled off the
half-bed, struck the floor, and
awoke. "First time I've fallen out
of bed in years," he groaned. His
shaking hand fumbled with the
switch and succeeded in turning
on the lamp.</p>

<p>Mrs. Calvin C. Kear sprawled
on her back in the other bed and
snored. "You and your fifteen-thousand-dollar
house," Kear
muttered. He combed his thinning
hair with his fingers. "You
and your sterling silver. You and
your chosen pattern. Your service
for eight. How far do you
think fifty-four dollars a week will
go with 12-gauge shells three and
a quarter a box?"</p>

<p>Green eyes glittered beside the
frilly dressing table. The man standing
there said, "I'm not igniting
you. I'm giving you a bonus for
your fine work. Enough currency to
pay the loan on this house. You'll be
making two hundred per week. This
fall, I'll take you hunting at my
place in the country."</p>

<p>"Boss?" Kear mumbled. "I
mean, Mr. Darmond?"</p>

<p>"Put on your clothing," the boss
said. "I'll show you your new office.
You may have a secretary,
also. I'm not firing you. I'm
giving you a bonus."</p>

<p>Kear sat gasping on the floor.
"That's great, boss!" he exclaimed.
"I thought I did an extra special
job on the plastics mill design.
It'll mean a lot to the company.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dress quickly."</p>

<p>Kear threw off his pajamas and
started stuffing arms and legs into
his clothes. Mrs. Kear opened
her eyes and squeaked like a dying
rabbit.</p>

<p>The bent rod in the boss's hand
hissed, and Mrs. Kear stopped
squeaking.</p>

<p>With tie flapping, shirt unbuttoned,
shoes unlaced, Kear followed
the boss through the living
room and down the flagstone walk
to the street. The boss opened the
doors of the <i>Honeychile Bakery</i>
truck and said, "In here."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mrs.</span> Jane Huprich dropped
her mop. Her varicose legs
trotted across the wet lobby of
the Jordon Building, and her flabby
fat arms reached for the tall man
with bright eyes who stood near
the elevators. "It's me, Mom," the
man cried.</p>

<p>"Matt!" Mrs. Huprich cried.
"Matt, baby!"</p>

<p>"I got a full pardon, Mom," Matt
said, stroking her tangled white
hair. "Right from the ruling
state official. You won't have to
scrub floors anymore! I'm going
straight, Mom. I'm a good mechanic
now. They learned me a lot
in the enclosure. Come on. I got
a used truck outside, I bought
cheap."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huprich and son walked
through the oddly twisted doors of
the Jordon Building and into the
gray twilight that awaited dawn.
The <i>Honeychile Bakery</i> truck
waited too.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Gary</span> Abston peddled his bicycle
against the flow of cars
carrying day-shift workers through
the half-light. He whirled into
Walnut Street, twisted a fresh
copy of the <i>Morning Herald</i> into
a fiendishly clever knot, and hurled
it in the general direction of a
front porch that flashed past on
his right. Never slowing, Gary
threw the next paper entirely across
the street. He chuckled as it
cleared a picket fence. "Bang,
bang!" he blurted. His red shirt,
with a picture of a mounted cowboy
on the back, ballooned in the
early morning breeze.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" Gary roared. He stopped,
held the bicycle upright with
one foot on the pavement. A tall,
lanky, slightly bowlegged man with
squinting luminous green eyes
stood on the sidewalk. Gary looked
at the man. The newspapers
fluttered to the parkway. The bicycle
clattered in the street.</p>

<p>"Howdy, partner!" the tall man
said. "The rustlers are headin'
for the plateau! We'll take the
short gash and head 'em off at the
canyon!"</p>

<p>"Ramrod Jones?" Gary chirped.</p>

<p>"Here's the truck I haul Quizz-kid,
the I.Q. Horse, in! Let's get
after the rustlers!" Jones said.</p>

<p>"Gee, I've seen all your pictures,
Ramrod," Gary said. "<i>Silver City
Raiders</i>, <i>Rustlers of Silver City</i>,
<i>Silver City Rustlers</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>The great cowboy lifted the
newsboy into the <i>Honeychile</i>
truck.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Pink</span> and rose clouds drifted
through a brightening sky as
the <i>Honeychile Bakery</i> truck careened
along a narrow road badly
in need of rock and grading. From
the road, the truck rattled into a
rutted track through dewy woods
and skidded swaying to a stop at
the side of a long, low, grassy hill.</p>

<p>The tall creature dressed in
black, red-spotted fur stepped from
the cab. An opening appeared in
the hillside. Four machines&mdash;dull
metal eggs balancing on single
tractor treads&mdash;rolled silently
through the opening. Jointed steel
arms darted from recesses in the
eggs. One machine opened the
truck doors.</p>

<p>The creature walked up a ramp
inside the hill and entered a shimmering
metallic compartment.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Eo. I have returned."</p>

<p>Eo, who wore a suit of white fur,
hummed, "None too soon, Za. We
miscalculated dawn. What success?"</p>

<p>"An excellent group," Za said.
He stretched and reclined on a
transparent slab. "The servants
are unloading the vehicle. I captured
a young male, a mature male,
an aged male, some sort of official
or guardian male, a mature female,
and an aged female."</p>

<p>"Let's view them," Eo said.
"You can rest after we're away."</p>

<p>The tall creatures entered a second
compartment furnished with a
large table upon which the silent
machines deposited inanimate bodies.
"Extraordinary!" said Eo,
staring at Miss Betsy Tapp.
"These things have reached a peak
of mammalian development!"</p>

<p>"Her correct garments are in this
bundle," Za explained. "The servants
are bringing the properties
now. I secured a signaling device
and a box used in an extremely
primitive system of communication.
Also, I brought the quaint muscle-powered
vehicle ridden by the
young male. The photographs
should be sufficient for other details."</p>

<p>"Any difficulty?" Eo asked as
the machines dumped Patrolman
Whedbee on the table.</p>

<p>"The language was the greatest
obstacle," Za said. "The same
word has many different meanings,
or many different words have the
same meaning. Rather crude."</p>

<p>"Did you use bait, or force?"</p>

<p>"Bait," Za said. "It's much simpler.
This is a completely selfish,
egocentric breed. Most of them
have one thing in mind which they
want solely for themselves. Their
sending power is weak, but that
one selfish desire is powerful
enough to be received. I merely
dangled it before their minds, and
they were hooked." He tapped
the foot of Calvin C. Kear. "I
killed this one's female companion.
She awoke and screamed. The
males and females pair off and live
together for years. Strange custom!
Breeding seems to be only
one reason for the mutual bondage."</p>

<p>Za pointed to Mrs. Jane Huprich.
"The old female may be an
exception to the selfishness. I
couldn't decide whether she most
wanted to be relieved of cleaning
floors by primitive methods, or
wanted her male offspring to be released
from some structure where
he had been secured for reasons I
couldn't determine."</p>

<p>The machines deposited the Reverend
Enos Shackelford and then
lined up in a precise row. "This
thing is dead!" Eo buzzed.</p>

<p>Za shook his head. "That was
the only genuine exception. He
confused me till I forgot his proper
clothing, but some can be devised
from the other samples. He seems
to have been a witch-doctor. His
mind was cluttered with myths and
superstitions from an ancient text.
I don't understand him, Eo, and
wish I had time to study the
phenomena. He was different from
the others. He believed in something
and considered himself lowly
and humble. The minds of the
others were in constant confusion.
They believed, actually, in nothing.
Somehow, he saw me, Eo. I was
forced to kill him."</p>

<p>"No harm done," Eo decided.
He faced the machines and said,
"Destroy the vehicle, draw in the
camouflage net, prepare for take-off."
The machines rolled from
the compartment, and the two creatures
followed.</p>

<p>"Seal it," Eo said. "I'll plasticize
them when we're in space.
Fine work, Za. I can see the
plaque now: 'Mounted by Eo, Collected
by Za. Typical Street Corner
on Planet <i>Earth</i>, Star <i>Sol</i>.'
The directors will surely give the
group a prominent place in the Galactic
Museum of Natural History!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Za agreed, glancing back
at the Reverend Enos Shackelford.
"This planet was a fortunate
stopover."</p>
